# Network Sniffer

This repository contains the `network_sniffer.py` script developed during my CodeAlpha Cybersecurity Internship. The script captures and analyzes network traffic to enhance security monitoring.

## How It Works

- Uses raw sockets to capture all incoming and outgoing network packets.
- Decodes packet headers to display information such as source and destination addresses, protocols, and payload data.
- Supports Ethernet, IP, TCP, and UDP protocols.
- Logs detailed packet information for further analysis.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mr-mucyo/codealpha_project.git
